## Inspiration
We are inspired by the importance of bees in our ecosystems and agriculture. The sharp declining bee populations are a major threat to biodiversity, food security, and environmental health. We created *Bee a Hero* to educate and encourage everyone to take action in an accessible and impactful way.

## What it Does
*Bee a Hero* is a website designed to raise awareness about the importance of bee conservation. Through educational content and an interactive game that is embedded into the website, we encourage our visitors to learn key facts about bee conservation and engage with the material in a way that is informative, memorable, and fun.

## How We Built It
We developed *Bee a Hero* using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually stimulating website. We began by planning and discussing effective ways to raise awareness about endangered bees. From there, we started building a website designed to present information in a clear and engaging way, avoiding large blocks of text. At the same time, we developed a simple and fun game about building your own flower garden. Once both the website and game had basic functionality completed, we focused on integrating them into a cohesive experience. Afterwards, we shifted our attention to refining and polishing the overall project.

## Challenges We Faced
One challenge we faced was integrating a fully functional game into the website without affecting performance or user experience. Another challenge we faced was having to refresh or relearn languages and tools used for this project in a short period of time. 

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We are proud of taking each of our individual skills and strengths, and utilizing them to create an amazing, functional project. We are also proud of our ability to work so well together in a group despite our different abilities.

## What We Learned
We learned a lot about endangered bees and what we can do to help them. We also learned to start with a strong idea and build off of it for a fully realized final product. The hardest part about a project is coming up with a realistic idea that solves a real problem.

## What's Next for *Bee A Hero*?
We will reach out to local schools to see if they will add our website to their pages to start informing the general public since our fun visuals and interactive game will be very engaging for children. We can also add more content to our website thanks to its scalability and flexibility.
